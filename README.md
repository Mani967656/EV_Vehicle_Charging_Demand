# 🔋 EV Charging Demand Forecasting

This project analyzes and forecasts the demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. As the adoption of EVs continues to grow rapidly, this notebook provides a data-driven approach to help city planners, utility companies, and policymakers make informed decisions about the placement and scaling of charging stations.

## 📈 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Forecast the demand for EV charging stations based on real-world vehicle usage data.
- **Use Case:** Helps predict infrastructure requirements and optimize public charging locations.
- **Approach:** Time series analysis and regression techniques to model EV usage trends.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Jupyter Notebook 📓
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for modeling)
- Prophet / ARIMA (for time series forecasting, if used)

## 📊 Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Time series visualization of EV growth trends
- Forecasting EV charging demand
- Scenario analysis for future adoption rates
